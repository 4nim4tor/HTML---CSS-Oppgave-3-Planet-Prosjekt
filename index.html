              Discovery: Mars has been known since ancient times, with
              telescopic observations beginning in the 1600s by Galileo. <br />
              Name: It’s named after the Roman god of war due to its red color,
              which resembles blood. <br />
              Size & Orbit: Mars is about half the size of Earth, with a
              diameter of 6,779 km. It orbits the Sun at 227.9 million km and
              has seasons like Earth but longer. <br />
              Atmosphere: Very thin, mostly carbon dioxide, with little
              protection from radiation. <br />
              Moons: Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, thought to be
              captured asteroids. <br />
              Exploration: Mars has been studied since the 1960s. Notable
              missions include NASA's Viking (1976), Curiosity Rover (2012), and
              Perseverance Rover (2020). <br />
              Key Features: It has the tallest volcano, Olympus Mons, and the
              longest canyon, Valles Marineris. <br />
              Search for Life: Evidence of water suggests Mars may have
              supported microbial life in the past.

              As of 2025, Mars exploration is advancing rapidly. NASA's
              Perseverance rover, launched in 2021, is actively studying the
              Jezero Crater and collecting samples for future return to Earth.
              The rover is also searching for signs of ancient microbial life.
              Meanwhile, China's Tianwen-1 mission, including the Zhurong rover,
              is exploring the Utopia Planitia region, analyzing the planet's
              surface and atmosphere. Additionally, NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter,
              part of the Perseverance mission, has made several successful
              flights, marking the first powered flight on another planet. This
              milestone is crucial for future aerial exploration. Mars missions
              continue to focus on studying the planet's geology, climate, and
              potential for human exploration, with hopes for human landings in
              the 2030s.

                  Humanity is exploring the idea of settling on Mars. Elon Musk,
                  the founder of SpaceX, has long shared his goal of creating a
                  self-sustaining city on the planet. NASA also plans to send
                  humans to Mars, starting with a mission to establish a human
                  presence on the Moon by the 2030s and eventually landing
                  astronauts on Mars in the 2040s.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Mars is home to the largest volcano in the Solar System,
                  Olympus Mons. Standing at 21 km tall, it’s about 2.5 times the
                  height of Mount Everest.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Mars' bigger moon, Phobos, is slowly getting closer to the
                  planet, moving toward it by about 2 cm every year. In 50
                  million years, it could either crash into Mars or break apart
                  and form a ring around the planet.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A long time ago, Mars resembled Earth, with large bodies of
                  liquid water covering much of its surface. There may have even
                  been early life forms in its oceans. However, Mars eventually
                  lost most of its atmosphere and became dry.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the late 1800s and early 1900s, astronomers believed they
                  saw a network of canals on Mars. Some thought these were
                  irrigation systems built by an alien civilization. But, it was
                  later discovered that these canals were an optical illusion.
